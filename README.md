# Machine-Learning


## First chunk
This code is an analytical pipeline for regression modeling. It starts by importing necessary libraries and fetching data from a remote source. The data is then prepared for modeling, including feature engineering. Three distinct regression models are applied sequentially.

First, a Linear Regression model is trained and assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a performance metric. The code generates a 3D visualization to display the model's predictions.

Next, a Random Forest Regressor is employed and evaluated, with the MSE computed to gauge its performance. The code also conducts k-fold cross-validation to establish a confidence interval for the MSE and performs a t-test to compare it against the Linear Regression model's performance.

Finally, a Neural Network model is defined and trained using TensorFlow/Keras. The code calculates and reports the MSE on both the test and training sets, offering insights into the neural network's generalization and performance.

Throughout the process, the code visualizes model predictions in 3D space. To ensure future accessibility, all three models are saved as pickle files. In essence, this code provides a comprehensive analysis of different regression techniques, offering a valuable perspective on their effectiveness in modeling the given dataset.


## Second chunk 
The primary function of this code is to assess the performance of a pre-trained machine learning model by measuring how well it predicts the target values on a given dataset using the MSE metric.
